  There are two types of data type in JavaScript, namely primitive type and
  reference type. We are going to cover primitive type over here only.

# Primitive Types

In the category of primitive types, aka value type, we have:

* String 
* Number
* Boolean 
* Undefined
* Null

Here are the examples:

```javascript
let name = 'My Name';       
let age = 18;               
let choice = true;          
let firstName = null        
let lastName = undefined    
```

let's check the type of the data using **`typeof`** in the console.
