  conditional statements to implement interactivity in our website.

# Conditional Statements

In JavaScript, we have two types of conditional statements:

* [If and Else](if-and-else-if....else.md)

```javascript
if (condition){
    action
}else (condition){
    action
}else{
    action
};  
```

* [Switch and Case](switch-and-case.md)

```javascript
switch (input){
    case input1
        action
        break;
    case input2
        action
        break;
    case input3
        action
        break;
    default:
        action
}
```
