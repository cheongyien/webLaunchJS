# :unlock:  Loops

>Loops are used to repeat the action stated in the curly braces { }.


There are mainly two types of loop that we will be learning:

* [While loop](while-loop.md)

> Have the following syntax

```javascript
  while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
  }
```

> Here's an example:

```javascript
  while(let counter = 0){
      console.log('Hi');
      counter ++;
  }
```

* [For loop](for-loop.md)

> Have the following syntax

```javascript
  for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    // code block to be executed
  }
```

> **Statement 1** is executed \(one time\) before the execution of the code block.

> **Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

> **Statement 3** is executed \(every time\) after the code block has been executed.

> So here's an example: 

```javascript
  for ( let counter = 0; counter <=5; counter ++ ){
      console.log('HI');
  }
```
