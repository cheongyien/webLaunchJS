## :triangular_flag_on_post: JavaScript

There are two types of programming languages:

- Static language
- Dynamic language

:heavy_check_mark:**Static language** is where the type of variable is set and cannot be changed in the future. For example:

```javascript
String name = 'Jeffrey';
```

:heavy_check_mark:On the other hand, the type of variable of a **dynamic language** can be changed at run time.

```javascript
let id = 12345;
```

I can change the value of id to any data type i want.
